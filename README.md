### My implementation of JLox programming language from crafting interpreters

I'm implementing the jlox lang following strictly the book but adding some features (readed in the exercises part).

My implementation support extra features:
- break statement
- lambda functions (with the dedicated resolver part too!)

UPDATE: The implementation is now complete with the two features working. Other extra features are for the clox interpreter, which for me is the right thing to do!
